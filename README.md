# Molecular Docking
This repository provides a demonstration of basic molecular docking using software tools such as AutoDock and ChimeraX. These techniques form part of the curriculum of the Bioinformatics practical course offered by Ahmedabad University, under the course code BIO205.

The relevant files were obtained from the [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5AIN) and the [PubChem database](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2244#section=3D-Conformer).

The software used may be downloaded from the following links:

* [UCSF ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/)
* [MGLTools](https://ccsb.scripps.edu/mgltools/)
* [AutoDock Vina](https://vina.scripps.edu/)
