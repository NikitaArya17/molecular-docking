# Molecular Docking
This repository provides a demonstration of basic molecular docking using software tools such as AutoDock and ChimeraX. These techniques form part of the curriculum of the Bioinformatics practical course offered by Ahmedabad University, under the course code BIO205.

The relevant files were obtained from the [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5AIN) and the [PubChem database](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2244#section=3D-Conformer).

The software used may be downloaded from the following links:

* [UCSF ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/)
* [MGLTools](https://ccsb.scripps.edu/mgltools/)
* [AutoDock Vina](https://vina.scripps.edu/)
* [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)


The 3D molecular structure of aspirin was downloaded from the PubChem database as an SDF file. The ChimeraX software was then used to convert this file to a PDB (Protein Data Bank) file. These intermediate files have been stored in a separate folder.
